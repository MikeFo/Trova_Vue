# Staging Build & Deploy

When building or deploying for **staging**, use:

- **Build for staging**: `npm run build:staging`
- **Deploy to staging**: Push to `staging` branch → Netlify auto-builds (`npm run build:staging`) and publishes to vue.trova-staging.com

Prefer `npm run build:staging` over `npm run build` when the target is staging.
